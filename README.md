## Getting Started

1. Type `/tp` to open the TighterProfessions window (make a /makro :wink:) 
2. Open each profession once (Alchemy, Tailoring, etc.) - the addon scans and caches your recipes automatically
3. Search, filter, and craft from the unified window

## Commands

| Command | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `/tp` | Toggle the window |

## Tips

- **Shift+Click** an item in your bags while the search box is focused to search for it
- Click column headers to sort by name, craftable quantity, or profit
- The recipe cache is per-character - switch characters and open professions again to populate
